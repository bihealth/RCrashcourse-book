    "text": "2.2 R, RStudio and other languages\n\n2.2.1 Why R?\n\n\n2.2.2 R and RStudio\nR is the name of both, the programming language and of the language interpreter. When you start RStudio, you can see the R language interpreter working in the part of the window left and bottom - called “console”. So yes, you don’t need RStudio to work with R and, in fact, many people prefer to work with R in a different environment.\nRStudio is a so called IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. That is, it provides a lot of goodies that help make your work easier, faster and more efficient.\n\n\n2.2.3 R and other languages\nR is not the only language that you can use for data analysis. There are many other languages that are used for this purpose, including Python, Matlab and many others. Each of these languages has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on your needs. In fact, most bioinformaticians know more than one language, and use the one that is best suited for the task at hand.\nWe think that R is a particularly good choice for all those who just need a tool to use from time to time to help them with their work. It is relatively easy to learn, and it is very powerful. However, other choices are also worth mentioning.\nMatlab is a language that is in many ways similar to R. The main differnce is maybe that unlike R, Matlab is not free – it is closed source and you have to pay for a license. This has some advantages. For example, and as you will see during this course, R development is not centralized and so there are many packages that do the same thing. Matlab is in some aspects more consistent and more polished than R, and in some comparisons appears to be faster – and for this, it is often the language of choice for areas such as image analysis.\nPython is completely different story. This is a powerful, fast, general purpose programming language. It is more versatile than R, has a much more standardized syntax and development process. However, it is harder to learn and it is not really meant to be used interactively (although it can be – especially when combined with Quarto or Jupyter Notebook). While many statistical modules exist for Python, it is not as strong in this area as R.",

    "section": "2.4 Let’s start with R",
    "text": "2.4 Let’s start with R\n\n2.4.1 R as a calculator\nYou can use R as a very powerful calculator. For example, do you want to know what \\(\\sin(\\pi/2)\\) is? Just type sin(pi/2) in the console and press Enter. Addition and subtraction work, as expected, with + and -. To multiply two numbers, type 2*3; to divide, type 2/3. You can get exponents (powers, eg. \\(2^3\\)) by typing 2^3. If the ^ symbol (called “caret”) is not available on your keyboard, you can use ** instead. Parentheses () are used to group expressions, just like in mathematics. To logarithmize, you can use log(), log2() and log10() functions. For example, to calculate \\(\\log_{10}(100)\\), type log10(100). Can you guess how to calculate \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)? Yes, you are right: sqrt(2). Or 2^(1/2), that will also do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Calculate the following expressions in R:\n\n\\(\\log_{2}(8)\\)\n\\(\\sin(\\pi)\\)\n\\(2^{10}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{e}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Using script files\nOn the left side of the RStudio window you have (by default) two panels: the lower one is called “Console”. When you create a new script file, it appears above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyping in console\n\n\n\nYou can type your commands (properly called “expressions”) directly into the console, but it is generally not a good idea. Why? The truthful answer is: because it is messy and sooner or later you will regret it. You can save the history of what you type in the console, but it is easier (and cleaner) to save your program in a script file.\n\n\nWhen you open or create an R script file and type something into it, you can run it by pressing Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on Mac). This will send the line of code to the console, where it will be executed. You can also select a fragment of the code before you press Ctrl+Enter, and then the whole selected fragment will be sent to the console.\nHowever, if you start your line with #, it will not be executed. This is called a comment and we will spend some time later on convincing you that you should use a lot of comments in your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Repeat Exercise 2.2, but now type the expressions into the script which you have created in Exercise 2.1. Run the script by pressing Ctrl+Enter after each line.\n\n\n\n\nScript files are also text documents. You can open them in any text editor, for example Notepad or even Word (but don’t do that). In RStudio, you see the script file in many colors: for example, comments can be green, strings (text in quotes) can be red, and so on. This is called syntax highlighting and is done by RStudio to make your code more readable. You will not see the colors when you open your R script in Notepad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFrom now on, you should only type your code in script files.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Variables\nWhat if we want to store the result of a calculation for later use? We can do this by assigning the result to a variable. In R, you assign a value to a variable using the &lt;- operator:\n\nx &lt;- 2\ny &lt;- sin(pi/2)\nz &lt;- x + y\n\nIf you want to see the value of a variable, just type its name in the console and press Enter, or use print() function:\n\nprint(z)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment operator\n\n\n\nMany other languages use = as an assignment operator. In R, you can use = as well, but do yourself a favour and don’t. Use &lt;- instead. Why? Your code will be more readable and you will avoid many common mistakes.\n\n\nVariables are like boxes in which you can store values. However, unlike boxes, when you assign one variable to another, the first variable keeps its content:\n\nx &lt;- 2\ny &lt;- x\nprint(x)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe now come to a very important point which we will revisit often, as it is one of the most common beginner (and not only beginner) mistakes. When you forget to assign the value to a variable, R will print it to the console, but the variable will not be modified:\n\nx &lt;- 2\n# prints 0.9092974:\nsin(x) \n# prints 2\nprint(x) \n\nIn the code above, the value of x is not changed by the sin() function. To store the value of a function, you need to assign it to a variable:\n\nx &lt;- 2\n# does not print anything:\nx &lt;- sin(x) \n# prints 0.9092974:\nprint(x)    \n\nPlease spend some time on this, as it is a very common source of errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb1, if the expression you type in your script does not contain the &lt;- operator, it will not modify any variables.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Character variables\nVariables can store not only numbers, but also text. Text in R is called a character string. To create a character string, you need to enclose the text in quotes (both single and double quotes are allowed, but try to be consistent and use only one type). For example:\n\nname &lt;- \"January\"\ncity &lt;- \"Hoppegarten\"\ngreeting &lt;- \"Hello, world!\"\n\nCharacter variables cannot be used with algebraic computations, the following code will throw an error:\n\n# this does not work!\nname + city\n\nHowever, if you want to “add” two character strings (that is, concatenate them), you can use the paste() function:\n\npaste(name, city)\n\n[1] \"January Hoppegarten\"\n\n\nQuite often, you don’t want to have a space between the two strings. This is such a common operation that R has a shortcut for it:\n\npaste0(name, city)\n\n[1] \"JanuaryHoppegarten\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther types\n\n\n\nThere are other types of data types in R. Later on, we will briefly touch on factors, which look like character strings but behave like numbers. And under the hood, numeric vectors can be either integers (numbers like 1, 2, …) or floating point numbers (numbers like 1.1, 2.2 or \\(\\pi\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4 (Variables) Create the following variables in your script:\n\nname with the value of your first name\ncity with the value of the city where you live\nage with the value of your age\ngreeting with the value “Hello,”\nconcatenate the variables greeting and name and store the result in a new variable message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Vectors and vectorization\nVariables can (and do) store a lot more than single values. One of the most basic and important data types in R is a vector. A vector is simply a sequence of values – just like in maths. And you know what? You have already created vectors in R. In mathematics, any scalar value can be treated as a one-dimensional vector and it is exactly like that in R: any single value is a 1-element vector, including all the variables that you have created in the previous exercise.\nTo create a vector with more than one value, you can use the c() function (“c” stands for “combine”). For integer numbers, you can use the : operator to create a sequence of numbers. For example:\n\nsequence &lt;- 5:15\nnumbers &lt;- c(10, 42, 33, 14, 25)\nperson &lt;- c(\"January\", \"Weiner\", \"Hoppegarten\")\n\nYou can access individual elements of a vector using the [ ] operator:\n\nnumbers[1]\n\n[1] 10\n\nperson[2]\n\n[1] \"Weiner\"\n\n\nBut hey, I told you that every value is a vector in R, right? And that includes the indices 1 and 2 that you have just used. So, what would happen if we used more than two values as an index? Try it:\n\nnumbers[1:3]\n\n[1] 10 42 33\n\nperson[3:1]\n\n[1] \"Hoppegarten\" \"Weiner\"      \"January\"    \n\nsel &lt;- c(1, 5, 3)\nnumbers[sel]\n\n[1] 10 25 33\n\n\nAs you can see, not only can you use a vector as an index, but you can also use a variable as an index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors and indices\n\n\n\nIn many (most?) programming languages, the first element of a vector is accessed using the index 0. For example in Python, to access the firs element of an array, you need to type array[0]. This has something to do with how computers work. In R, the first element is always 1 – R was designed by statisticians, and in mathematics we always start counting from 1. For some reason, this seems to make some computer scientists angry.\n\n\nBut wait, there is more. What happens if we add a value to a vector? Try it:\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(10, 42, 33, 14, 25)\nnumbers + 10\n\n[1] 20 52 43 24 35\n\n\nAs you can see, R has added the value 10 to every single element of the vector numbers. The same thing happens with other operators, like -, * and /. Try it yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.5 (Vectorisation)  \n\nCreate a vector with several numbers and try to add, subtract, multiply and divide it by a single number. What happens?\nSay, you have three values which are the diameters of three circles: 1, 5 and 13. You would like to have a vector containing the areas of these circles. What is the simplest way of doing that?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is called vectorization and it is one of the most powerful features of R compared to other languages. It will allow you to write very concise and, at the same time, readable code.\nHowever, there is a catch. What happens if you try to add two vectors when both of them with more than one element? First, let us try to add two vectors of the same length:\n\nnumbers1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nnumbers2 &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\nnumbers1 + numbers2\n\n[1] 5 7 9\n\n\nAs you can see, R has added the first element of the first vector to the first element of the second vector, the second element of the first vector to the second element of the second vector, and so on. Makes sense, right? Same would happen if we were to subtract, multiply or divide the vectors (or use logical operations, which you will learn on Day 3). This does not look like much now, but trust me, it will be extremely useful in the future.\nHowever, if the vectors have different lengths, it is a different story altogher. Take a look:\n\nnumbers1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nnumbers2 &lt;- c(4, 5)\nnumbers1 + numbers2\n\nWarning in numbers1 + numbers2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length\n\n\n[1] 5 7 7\n\n\nOoops, what exactly happened here? First thing to note is that there was no error. There was a warning, but still our code executed and produced a result. But what is that result? For the first element of the result, it is clear enough: 1 + 4 = 5. Same for the second, 2 + 5 = 7. But what about the third? It seems that R added 3 + 4 = 7. But why?\nR noticed that it is missing an element to be added to the third element of the vector numbers1. So, it did what is called recycling. It “rewound” the vector numbers2 to the beginning and added the first element of numbers2 to the third element of numbers1. However, since after the rewinding and adding one element of vector numbers2 was left (because numbers1 did not have any more elements), R issued a warning. If the length of the first vector was a multiple of the length of the second vector, R would not have complained:\n\nnumbers1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\nnumbers2 &lt;- c(7, 8)\nnumbers1 + numbers2\n\n[1]  8 10 10 12 12 14\n\n\nSee? No warning. R was recycling the second vector over and over again. Recycling is a dangerous business: if you are not careful, you can get results which you have not expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecycling advice\n\n\n\nHere is our advice to you: either use a vector and a single element vector, or two vectors of the same length. And in the cases where, for some reason, you need to recycle, make sure that you know what you are doing. For example, check the length of both vectors.\n\n\nWith vectors that have only a couple of numbers it is quite easy to see what is happening, but what if you have thousands of variables? In other words, how to check the lenght of a vector? You can use the length():\n\nlength(numbers1)\n\n[1] 6\n\nlength(numbers2)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nOK, one more thing about vectors. Above we have selected elements from a vector. It turns out, we can do more with that selections then just print it to a console:\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(10, 42, 33, 14, 25)\nsel &lt;- c(1, 5)\nnumbers[sel] &lt;- c(100, 500)\nnumbers\n\n[1] 100  42  33  14 500\n\n\nHere is what happened: we assigned new values to the first and the fifth element of the vector numbers. This is a very powerful feature of R and you will be using it a lot.\n\n\n2.4.6 Water lillies on a lake\nThere is an old puzzle that goes: “On a lake, there is a water lily. Each day the lily doubles in size. After 30 days, the lily covers the entire lake. On which day was the lily covering half of the lake?”.\nIn the following section we will model the behavior of the lily using R. Let us start with some assumptions. First: we designate the first day as Day 1. Second: every day, the lily doubles the area it covers. Third: on the first day, the lily covers 1% of the lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.6 (Modelling water lilies) Take a piece of paper and a pen. Your task is to come up with a formula to describe the area of the lily on the \\(n\\)-th day. Write down the formula.\nHint: if you are stuck, try to calculate the area of the lily on the first few days.\n\n\n\n\nThere is an important point that we wish to demonstrate here. Quite often it pays off to close your laptop and think for a moment what it is it that you want to do, rather than start coding right away. Pen and paper are helpful (we will be making this point again when it comes to visualizations). If you do not have a clear idea of what you want to do, you can get stuck thinking about what you already know how to do.\nThe formula for calculating the area of the lily on the \\(n\\)-th day is \\(0.01 \\times 2^{n-1}\\). You can come up with that result quite easily if you consider the first few days. On day 1, the area is \\(1\\% = 0.01\\). On day 2, is twice that, that is, \\(0.01 \\times 2 = 0.01 \\times 2^1 = 0.02\\). On day 3, it is twice the area from the previous day: \\(0.02 \\times 2 = 0.04 = 0.01 \\times 2\n\\times 2 = 0.01 \\times 2^2\\). And again, on day 4, it is \\(0.01 \\times 2^3\\). And so on2.\nOnce we have the formula, it is very easy to calculate the area covered by water lillies on the first 10 days. We will use vectorization to do this:\n\ndays &lt;- 1:10\narea &lt;- 0.01 * 2^(days - 1)\narea\n\n [1] 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.08 0.16 0.32 0.64 1.28 2.56 5.12\n\n\nThis calls out for a plot. We will talk about visualizations more extensively on Day 5, but for now, we will use a very basic and simple function to plot the area of the lily on the first 30 days. The function is called plot() and can be used to plot a graph of two vectors. The first vector is the days, the second vector is the area.\n\nplot(days, area, type=\"b\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO-K, days and area are clear, but what is this type=\"b\"? This is a so-called named argument3. The plot() function has many arguments, and if you want to use only some of them, you can use their names with an equal sign. You will see that a lot in the days to come. This particular argument, type, tells R what kind of plot to draw. The \"b\" stands for “both” and tells R to draw both points and lines. If you want only points, you can use \"p\" (or simple leave the argument out), if you want only lines, you can use \"l\".\nNote another thing on this plot: after day 7, the area is greater than 1. But 1 means 100%, so after day 7, the lily covers more than the entire lake. Obviously, this is not possible – and it shows a limitation of our model.",

    "text": "2.5 Coding practices\n\n2.5.1 Computer programs as means for communication\nIt is now time to conclude today’s lesson with a bit of philosophy. When you write an R script, the first goal you have in mind is to analyse your data – in other words, by means of what you write you are trying the computer to do something for you. That is correct and fine, but there is an important aspect of programming that is often overlooked.\nWhen you write a program, you are writing it not only for the computer, but also for other people. These other people may include your colleagues, readers of your scientific articles, your students, and, last but not least, a future version of yourself. All these people need more then just a piece of code that works. You will quickly find it out yourself when you open a script or a project that you have not been working on for a few months – trust me on this, you will not know what it does, how it does and sometimes even whether you have written it or copied from somewhere.\nYou might be thinking that you are never willing to show your code to another person. You are wrong, and not only because it is useful to you for another person to review your code. Firstly, you will want to share your code because as a scientist you will want to share your results, and results are nothing if the methods to obtain them are unknown. And secondly, you will need to share your code because you will be asked to do so by your colleagues (yes, I was as surprised as you will be when I was asked to share my code for the first time). And thirdly, your code is part of your methods and you will have to share it when you publish your results4.\nFor communication with another human being to be efficient, you need to make it as clear as possible. There are several ways how to make your code more readable and understandable. Here are some of them.\nComments. Comments are lines in your code that are not executed. In R, they start with a # sign. Comments help to explain what exactly are you trying to achieve with your code. The old saying goes: “Code tells you how, comments tell you why”. You can hardly overdo with comments, but you can easily underdo.\nNaming. The names of your variables, functions and files should be meaningful. If you have a variable that stores the number of days, call it days, not x. If you have a function that calculates the area of a circle, call it calculate_circle_area(), not f(). If you have a comma separated values (CSV) file that contains the CRP values, call it crp_values.csv, not data.txt.\nFormatting. Your code should be formatted in a consistent way. For example, you should always put a space around your operators, like x &lt;- 2 (and not x&lt;-2), you should always put a space after a comma, like c(1, 2) and not c(1,2) (and also not c( 1 , 2 )). See here for a more detailed guide on how to format your code.",
