# A Five Day Course in Data Science - Companion Book

At the Core Unit for Bioinformatics at the Berlin Institute of Health,
Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, we have developed a five-day, 5 hour
per day crash course running for the last three years. This book is a
companion to that course.

This is also the reason for how the materials in the book are arranged.
Rather then discussing everything about vectors first, then everything
about matrices etc., we start with easy things, and return to them later to
build on them. I call this "helical learning" – we spiral around the same
topics, but each time going a bit deeper, and each time you will understand
a bit more. This is also why some topics are spread between the days – by
trial and error, we have found the amount of material that can be covered
in a day of learning.

There are two goals of this book. The first one is that 
after five days of learning R, you will be able to load, inspect,
manipulate and save data files (such as Excel tables or CSV files), make
some basic plots and perform simple statistical tests. The second goal is
that you are in a good starting position to continue learning R on your own.

In other words, this course should give you a jump start, allow to overcome
this first hurdle of learning R.
